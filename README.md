# STARCASES_BASEBOM

This represents the base POM for most of my
initial projects which are commonly SpringBoot based.

Not every app or service will use every dependency
specified but most items here should apply. Examples of
what may not apply include the JKUBE properties if the
app/service won't be deployed into a K8s cluster.
