# STARCASES_BASEBOM

This represents the base POM for a set of other POM
files. Sub-POM projects included here are quarkuspom
which is the base POM for my Quarkus based projects,
sbpom for my SpringBoot based projects and others
as needs arise.

Not every app or service will use every dependency
specified but most items here should apply. Examples of
what may not apply include the JKUBE properties if the
app/service won't be deployed into a K8s cluster.
